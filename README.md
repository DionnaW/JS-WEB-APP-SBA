# JS-WEB-APP-SBA
I've decided to do my wep app about cats. I am a cat mom, so why not?

For some reason my api key is returning 404 a dn I'm tired, so I'll be back at it after school tomorrow

3-22
I got it on a roll now. Pictures from my cat api the change everytime the page is refreshed
so far for the requirements i have used fetch api, used GET request to create user interaction, now i am on to the others...
