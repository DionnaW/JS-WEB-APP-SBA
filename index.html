    <h1>Fun Facts <br>About Cats</h1>

    <p>
      The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.<br>
      Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.<br>
      As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat.<br>
      As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.<br>
      Most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws. The claws on the forefeet are typically sharper than those on the hindfeet.<br>
      During a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility.<br>
      Cats have excellent night vision and can see at one sixth the light level required for human vision.<br>
      The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz. t can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz.<br>
      Cats have an acute sense of smell; it allows them to sense certain aromas in a way that humans cannot.<br>
      Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue).<br>
      To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces.<br> These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents;
