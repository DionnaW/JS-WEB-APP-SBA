    <h1>Fun Facts <br>About Cats</h1>

    <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. <br> Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.<br>It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.<br> It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws, it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats.<br> It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.<br> Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language.<br> It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It also secretes and perceives pheromones.<br>
      As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat.<br> In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.<br> As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.
